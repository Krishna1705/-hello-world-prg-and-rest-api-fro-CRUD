# hello-world-program-using-express-js
this is first hello world program using express js.
it contains application configuarations in config/appConfig.js folder,
which teaches us that which things should be included as aplication configuration while planning our application.
so in future if u want to make some changes in ur application then u only need to go through this appConfig.js file,
u dont need to go through each and every file in ur application and make the changes,
this trick rally comes in handy while working on a big project...
(i have addeed node_modules folder in .gitignore)
